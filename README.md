# My-Portfolio-Web
I developed a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences in web development. The website features a clean, modern design with a responsive layout, ensuring it adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices. Including a dynamic navigation menu and interactive buttons.
